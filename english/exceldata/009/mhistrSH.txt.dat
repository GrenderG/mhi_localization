Those of later ages
will look back upon
these fierce and dazzling
centuries and speak thus:
An era when the land, the sky,
and most of all, its people,
were brimming with the very
essence of life.
The world was far simpler
than it is now.
There were but two choices...
To hunt... or be hunted.
To secure tomorrow's sustenance,
to test one's own strength,
or to claim riches and renown,
people gathered in this land.
You are:
a rookie hunter.
Ahead of you lie many
challenges that you will
have to confront head-on.
May the time you spend in
this world become a memory
you will never forget:
A MEMORY OF GREATNESS.
Only 1 save can exist at once.
Until you start and save again
previous data won't be erased.
Can be changed outside the title screen.
