Those in the future
will look back
and tell tales of these rough
yet dazzling centuries.
Of the land, the sky,
and yet above all, it was also a time
full of people that lived
to their fullest.
The world was
far more simpler than it is now.
That is to say...
You either hunt, or be hunted.
To bring food to tomorrow's table.
To test your strength.
Or perhaps to earn a fortune or fame.
People gather round to these lands.
You are:
a rookie hunter.
Ahead of you lie many
challenges that you will
have to confront head-on.
We hope that during your time
here in this world,
you will create truly
unforgettable memories.
Only 1 save can exist.
