In the future,
those who come after us
will look back at these
rough yet dazzling centuries
and speak of them.
The land, the sky,
and above all, the people who lived
there were a time
full of the greatest vitality.
The world was, in many ways,
far simpler than it is now.
That is to say, it was a world of
either hunting or being hunted.
To earn food for tomorrow,
to test one's strength,
or perhaps to gain wealth
and fame, people gathered here.
You are a rookie hunter.
Before you stand
many obstacles,
and you will have to
face them head-on.
We hope that the time you spend
in this world becomes a
good memory for you.
Only 1 save can exist.
Until you start and save again
previous data won't be erased.
Can be changed outside the title screen.
