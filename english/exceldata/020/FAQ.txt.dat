Capturing Monsters

In order to capture a monster,
you must first weaken it by
inflicting damage on it.
When a monster is weakened,
it will sometimes limp.

Once the monster is weakened,
hit it with two consecutive
"Tranq Bombs" or "Tranq Shots"
to successfully capture it.

However, if you land only one
"Tranq Bomb" or "Tranq Shot"
and the monster escapes,
the first hit will not count,
and you'll need to start over.
