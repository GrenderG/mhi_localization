Well met.
I'm this village's chief,
and from the looks of it,
you're a new hunter.
Ho...
Well, you've a keen eye.
You just may be able to
become a great hunter.
Very well.
If you really want to be a
first-rate hunter, let me
share what I've learned...
...everything that, as the
≪Hero of Kokoto≫
I've learned in this here
village.
For a hunter such as you,
here's ≪Leather Armor≫.
It's not much, however,
it'll do.
By the way, ≪Leather Armor≫
cannot be sold.
Remember that, now.
Come back when you've made
your preparations.
Are you ready?
We'll start by learning the
basics with a simple quest.
I'm this village's chief,
the ≪Hero of Kokoto≫.
Where you are now is the
base camp, your starting
point.
In this base camp, there's
a ≪Supply Box≫, as well as
a ≪Delivery Box≫. Both have
been set up here.
In the ≪Supply Box≫,
you'll find items that will
assist you on your hunt.
Supply items are returned 
at the end of the quest, so
you can't bring them back.
The ≪Delivery Box≫ is for
delivering items required
for a quest.
Deliver all required items,
and the quest is complete.
By the way, while on a
quest, you can only save in
the base camp.
Now, go into the field,
hunt an aptonoth, and
collect some raw meat.
Look at your top right.
There you can find icons
that show your status and
other various conditions.
The ≪Eyecon≫ you see right
now means that there's a
monster in this area.
There are many other icons,
but I'm sure you'll learn
them as you go.
Now, have a safe journey!
A hunter must learn to be
self-sufficient.
If you grill the raw meat
you get from monsters,
it'll become edible.
Take the ≪Portable Spit≫
from the supply box, and
get hunting!
The trick to grilling meat
well is good timing!
Once the song ends, watch
for when the meat changes
color. Press ≪Confirm≫, and
you've a well-done steak!
Are you ready?
Commence the grilling!!
Ah, item gathering.
Find the required items in
the field, and put them in
delivery box.
The ≪Herb≫ you need can be
found in areas 1 & 2.
If you see anything out of
the ordinary, press
≪Confirm≫ to search it.
Also, in every quest, there
is a time limit.
This can be found in the
top left of the screen.
Don't forget it!
Ah, combining items.
Gather an ≪Herb≫ and a
≪Blue Mushroom≫, then
combine to make a ≪Potion≫.
Don't forget to put the
≪Potion≫ you just made into
the delivery box!
Ah, fishing.
If you have a lure,
you can fish at any fishing
point.
Take this ≪Worm≫, and go
fishing!
There should be a fishing
point in area 10.
To fish with any finesee,
good timing is critical.
When the fish bites and a
!! appears over your head,
press ≪Confirm≫.
If you mess up the timing,
you may even lose your
bait!
When you run out of bait,
in the grass you can find
a ≪Worm≫ or ≪Cricket≫ for
bait.
Ah, mining.
The ores you can get from
mining are helpful for
upgrading your gear!
Grab this ≪Old Pickaxe≫,
and get mining!
Rocks where a
≪Mining Point≫ can be found
have cracks in them.
Try checking area 4, you
shouldn't have much trouble
finding ≪Iron Ore≫ there.
There are ≪Wyvern Egg≫ in
the nest in area 4.
The only problem is,
a ≪Rathalos≫ has been seen
guarding that area.
They're too powerful for
you to face one-on-one, so
don't think of fighting it!
If you press ≪Confirm≫
where there's eggs, you can
pick one up.
Eggs are extremely fragile!
They'll break if you get
hit by a monster's attack.
Also, since carrying the
egg will occupy both hands,
drawing a weapon, using an
item, or simply becoming
fatigued from sprinting
will cause you to drop it.
Be very careful about the
actions you take.
Now you should see a light
blue circle; this is an
icon that means you're
currently in a cold area,
such as caves.
While this icon is active,
your stamina will drain,
so be careful.
If it doesn't show up,
that's because you've drank
a hot drink.
A ≪Hot Drink≫ will 
give resistance to the cold
for a fixed amount of time.
Remember that.
Now you should see a red
circle; this is an icon
that means you're currently
in a hot area, such as the
≪Desert≫.
While this icon is active,
you will gradually lose
health, so be careful.
If it doesn't show up,
that's because you've drank
a cool drink.
A ≪Cool Drink≫ will 
give resistance to the heat
for a fixed amount of time.
Remember that.
Area 8 has ≪Herbivore Egg≫
aplenty.
They're a bit hard to find,
but if you search carefully
you should find it.
Good, good.
This is area 8!
あ
あ
あ
≪Sootstone Ore≫, hmm... you
should be able to find it
in both areas 4 & 10.
You can get ≪Sootstone Ore≫
by mining.
Good, good.
Don't forget to bring a
pickaxe!
あ
あ
≪Powderstone≫ can be found
in area 6.
Once you pick one up, you
can't use items 'till you
drop it, so don't forget to
drink a ≪Cool Drink≫
beforehand!
あ
あ
あ
You can find ≪Wyvern Egg≫
in area 3.
There's a ≪Rathian≫ on the
prowl there however, so
take proper precaution!
あ
あ
To capture a monster, you
need to hit it twice with
either ≪Tranq Bomb≫ or
≪Tranq Ammo≫ from the
supply box.
Of course, if the monster
isn't weakened, it can't be
captured regardless.
When the monster takes
enough damage, it'll start
limping. Capture it then!
Oh, I forgot to say, but if
end up killing the monster,
you'll fail the quest.
The kinds of quests you can
take are dependant on your
hunter rank.
However, just raising your
hunter rank won't let you
take on new quests.
Complete enough and you can
take on an ≪Urgent Quest≫.
If you can complete that,
you'll be allowed to take
on more difficult quests.
Of course,
this is only provided that
you are of sufficient
hunter rank.
It seems you've mostly
gotten the basics down.
But,
you've only just begun.
What is a hunter?
What is a hunter's way of
life?
Is it to make a name for
oneself as a master hunter?
Or is it to make a name as
a collector of rare items?
What you make of it, that's
up to you to decide.
You're really starting to
come together now!
Let me give you a piece of
advice:
As you increase your hunter
rank, the stores you visit
often may get more
available stock.
Be sure to drop by often,
yeah?
A hunter must keep presence
of mind, no matter what
kind of environment they're
in.
In places that drain your
health, like the ≪Desert≫,
it's important to make full
use of your items and keep
your senses sharp!
The ≪Desert≫ is the home of
≪Monoblos≫, a one-horned
flying wyvern. However,
now is not yet the time for
you to challenge it.
If you happen to come
across it, don't even think
of trying to fight it!
Good, good.
The Bird Wyvern ≪Gypceros≫.
Watch out for its attacks
with a blinding flash!
Get caught in it, and you'll
be seeing stars.
To avoid its flash attack,
you can utilize either a
≪Guard≫ or ≪Dive-Evade≫.
Like the desert, the
≪Crags≫ & ≪Volcano≫ both
have health-draining heat.
Be sure you're prepared!
Here's some helpful advice
for you:
Beware the poisonous gas of
the rocky wyvern Basarios,
as it can't be blocked!
Remember it well.
Some monsters have been
confirmed to inhabit
multiple locales.
Their strength may vary
slightly depending on their
habitat.
You've done well to here.
From here on out, expect
quests to only get more
difficult.
Proceed with care.
I've a piece of advice for
you:
High-rank quests are more
likely to have larger-sized
monsters.
Hoh.
≪Rathalos≫ & ≪Rathian≫...
to have grown enough to
slay even them both...
you just may be becoming a
real master hunter.
Very well.
Let me give you this.
Bring it to the blacksmith,
and he'll give you a very
special weapon, the
≪Hero's Blade≫.
It's the same blade I used.
Lately the appearance of an
unusually colored monster
has caused quite a ruckus.
However, color is not the
only difference: their
element is different too!
Some of the attacks of
≪Azure Rathalos≫ have
water element in them too!
Elemental weakness?
If I remember right, fire.
Ahh, the one-horned wyvern
≪Monoblos≫...
I've bested one before, but
now is the time for you too
to prove yourself by
challenging it.
I've already heard talk
from the villagers!
That you've defeated the
single-horned beast!
Incredible, without a doubt
the new ≪Hero of Kokoto≫
is you!
Allow me to grant you this:
proof that you are a master
hunter.
Bravo, slaying the
≪Monoblos≫!
≪Hero of Kokoto≫！
I'm really surprised by all
you've been able to do!
You've now become a fully
fledged hunter!
Congratulations!
I haven't a thing left to
teach you, but don't think
that you can slack off now!
Now get going,
≪Hero of Kokoto≫!
When ya wanna upgrade your
weapon choose ≪Upgrade≫,
and when ya wanna make a
new one choose ≪Forge≫.
When upgrading or forging
a weapon, of course ya need
money & materials, but
weapons for beginners can
be just bought, so... well,
have a look for yourself.
If you're looking to use a
bowgun, you'll need to
carry your own ≪Ammo≫.
If ya don't have ≪Ammo≫
for your bowgun, it'll just
be one heavy hunk of junk!
≪Ammo≫ can be found at the
≪Item Shop≫.
Hey!
You've been working hard,
yeah? Well listen.
The other day, when I was
out fishing in the jungle,
I caught a golden fish!
When I sold it, I got a big
haul, lots-a money, hohooo,
DARN was I thrilled!
You may just fall in love
with the lance's depth!
Even while guarding you can
move & attack, and if you
charge? Hah, you'll run 'em
over! Monsters'll fear ya!!
Furthermore, while charging
press ≪Confirm≫, and you'll
perform a finishing thrust!
It's the perfect balance of
offense and defense.
Didja know?
The damage of a gunner
weapon's shots vary based
on how far they travel.
Too close or far? Ya may as
well just hurl rocks at it.
Stand back just a bit, and
you'll be in the green!
Ya know, there are many
weapons that have elemental
attributes.
Monsters have them too, so
the best thing to do is to
pick out the element it's
weak to! If ya do that, you
can deal even more damage!
No reason not to, at least.
Here's a fun fact: some
weapons don't just increase
your attack!
There are some weapons
that, just by equipping it,
raise your defense too.
Today I'll teach ya my
weakness: all it takes is
one good slap!
But, punch me as much as ya
like and I'm rock-solid.
Monsters are the same way.
Some are sturdy to hammer's
blunt strikes, and others 
weak to a blade's cuts, or
resist a gunner's shots.
But, whatever the monster,
there's always a weakpoint.
Find the places where your
attacks seem effective.
To be honest, I'm known
for my hardheadedness.
I can deflect any weak
sword I find with a
"shwing"!
Monsters are the exact same
and also have hard & soft
parts.
Try to find the soft parts
of each monster you
encounter.
Didja know that some
monsters give you
additional materials upon
breaking their parts?
For example, if you cut the
tail of a ≪Rathalos≫,
you'll get ≪Rathalos Tail≫.
There're many others, so
try finding them yourself.
It seems like monsters've
been giving you more
trouble lately, huh.
Hm... now may be the time
to upgrade to gear that
uses ≪Machalite Ore≫.
Although, didja know
there's an ore that one-ups
even that?
≪Dragonite Ore≫!
Also called ≪Dragonstone≫,
it really is a miracle ore.
If I could get my hands on
some of that, I can make ya
some truly amazing weapons.
Awhile ago, there was a lad
who brought me some
≪Ruststone≫...
...from there I was able to
turn it into something
rather impressive.
Seems it doesn't become the
same thing every time,
though.
The other day I was doing
the same, and was surprised
to make a Hunter's Knife!
I see the look in your eye!
Reminds me of my youth...
By the way, have ya
gotten any ≪Union Ore≫
yet?
It's more valuable than
≪Dragonite Ore≫, so keep
your eyes peeled if ya
wanna make something
stronger than whatcha have.
Hey!
Ever seen a weapon called
≪Breath Core Hammer≫?
Even amongst other hammers
it's sure to pack a punch.
I'm just SURE I saw it when
polishing a weapon made
from ≪Ruststone≫...
Say, do ya know what a
≪Firestone≫ is?
Those babies are quite
incredible, really.
They're in a constant state
of burning.
They've got a nasty habit
of not wanting to work with
anything they don't have an
affinity towards, but they
always make strong gear.
Each armor set can only
be upgraded up to 
≪Level 5≫.
Though, it seems that some
special sets can be
upgraded up to ≪Level 7≫.
When you have the materials
to craft or improve your
armor, let me know anytime.
Do you know about the
≪Skills≫ armor sets have?
Each armor set have special
abilities attached to them
called ≪Skills≫.
Some skills are there from
the start, while others
can be activated or
improved by upgrading
armor.
What's that? That was your
first time hearing this?
Greetings, how are things
going?
From my research as a
ticket enthusiast, I can
tell you there's many kinds
of tickets that exist.
≪Egg Ticket≫, ≪BBQ Ticket≫
≪Jewel Ticket≫, and don't
forget ≪Old Lady's Note≫!
Obviously there's more too.
Of course, I'm no hunter,
and I have no clue what
they're used for.
Have you ever heard of a
skill called ≪Eating≫
before?
When eating stuff like
BBQ steak, you'll feel more
full... or something.
Is it truee?
An often-used gunner skill
is ≪Normal S Attack Up≫.
I've heard that this
increases the power of
bowgun Normal S Ammo.
Looking at the armor set
made from the materials of
a certain monster can give
a hint as to its weakness.
For example if the armor is
weak to fire, it'd make
sense if the monster too...
Well, you get it, right?
There are a few exceptions,
but there's no harm in
using this trick.
≪Velociprey Armor≫,
≪Genprey Armor≫, and
≪Ioprey Armor. 
Once upgraded, these three
have skills that resist
abnormal statuses like
poison, paralysis, etc.;
and are effective against
monsters that use them.
I've heard the news.
A ≪Rathalos≫ has been
spotted.
The attacks of ≪Rathalos≫
have fire & dragon element,
so if you use armor weak to
them you'll disadvantaged.
Please be careful.
Welcome! How are things
going for you?
As a ticket enthusiast,
my research has led me to
the fact that there are so
many tickets I didn't even
know existed!
≪Pawprint Stamp≫
≪Guild Ticket≫
≪Silver Ticket≫!
≪Gold Ticket≫!!
How many kinds ARE there??
Oh well, I'm no hunter,
beats me what they're even
used for.
Do you know the ≪Guard+≫
skill?
I recommend it to anybody
looking to reduce the
damage taken when guarding
a monster's attacks.
How goes the hunts?
It's really amazing how you
bested both a ≪Rathalos≫
AND a ≪Rathian≫!
I meant only to say that,
but so you know, both
≪Rathalos Armor≫ and
≪Rathian Armor≫ can be
upgraded to ≪Level 7≫.
There are a couple skills
that increase the reward
for quest completion, like
≪Good Luck≫ and 
≪Luck Booster≫.
These skills are unusual,
but of course are no less
useful.
Congratulations on slaying
the one-horned wyvern!
I've added 
≪Monoblos Armor≫ to the
list of craftable armor, so
please let me know when you
get the materials & money!
≪Farsight≫.
Even when you don't have a
≪Map≫, this skill allows
you to see the whole map!
Sounds really useful, huh?
If you don't need a ≪Map≫,
that's just free extra
space in your item pouch!
In my shop you can find a
varied assortment of items!
Though there's only 21
slots in your item pouch,
hm...
When your pouch gets full,
you can always put some in
your ≪Storage≫.
≪Storage≫?
You can access your storage
≪Storage≫ via ≪My House≫.
Have you gone fishing and
bug-catching?
Those items can be very
helpful in ≪Combining≫.
Especially when it comes to
getting high-level ≪Ammo≫,
I recommend ≪Combining≫,
using fish as ingredients.
Seems a monster has
appeared, huh.
If you go to fight it, be
sure to bring plenty of
healing items!
My recommendation this time
is a ≪Cool Drink≫.
They're a neccesity in hot
areas such as the ≪Desert≫
and ≪Volcano≫.
Of course, I've plenty of
other useful items too!
Have you been making sure
you have enough
≪Hot Drink≫?
The caves found in the
≪Swamp≫ are so cold they'll
drain your stamina!
So I hope you've been
making sure when exploring
to drink a ≪Hot Drink≫!
Seems a Gypceros appeared.
If you go to fight it,
don't forget to bring your
≪Antidote≫!
"How do I make it" you say?
Oh honey... well, I'll
teach you just this once.
≪Antidote≫ can be made by
combining ≪Antitode Herb≫
and ≪Blue Mushroom≫.
We've got new items in
stock now!
Feel free to have a look.
Hey, do you have enough
≪Cool Drink≫? You'll
need them.
The ≪Volcano≫ has even more
hot places than the
desert, so be sure to bring
many ≪Cool Drink≫,
alright?
If you plan ahead before
taking on a fight with a
large monster, you can have
an edge by bringing items!
Like if you fight in the
≪Volcano≫, don't forget to
bring many ≪Cool Drink≫!
My recommendation this time
is the ≪Mega Pickaxe≫ and
≪Mega Bug Net≫.
They're quite sturdy, and
rarely break.
Of course, I have plenty of
other helpful items too!
Isn't it a bit annoying,
having only normal potions
to heal you in combat?
Try combining ≪Potion≫ and
≪Honey≫ sometime. You'll
get something real good!
Have you already bought an
≪Armorcharm≫ yet,
hunter?
They're a bit expensive,
but your defense increases
just by holding one!
≪Purple Gypceros≫ has been
spotted in the ≪Swamp≫, so
be sure to prepare!
I heard that you slayed the
one-horned wyvern!
Isn't that just wonderful??
What a splendid hunter
you've grown to be.
To think my shop aided
you... I'm so happy!
You may be a first-rate
hunter now, that's true...
But don't go off thinking
you can get away with 
forgetting to buy items!
Got it? Good.
Hey you, got any
≪Huntercoin≫?
You'll need ≪Huntercoin≫
if you wanna buy from me.
Well, my lineup's a bit
barren right now, but check
back in for good stuff!
How to get the coins?
You can get ≪Huntercoin≫
after completing quests
to hunt large monsters.
You may not have any now,
but don't forget it, yeah?
Out in the field, there's a
monster called ≪Mosswine≫.
From them, you can get a
≪Special Mushroom≫.
Any real hunter knows which
materials can be obtained
from what monsters!
Earlier when I was out
exploring the caves of the
≪Jungle≫, I got a
≪Machalite Ore≫.
'Course, any good hunter
knows where to search for
the materials they need.
In the ≪Desert≫, you can
get an item called
≪Cactus Flower≫.
Oddly enough, you can often
find ≪Power Seed≫ where
they grow.
In the ≪Swamp≫ you can find
plenty of different
types and varieties of
mushroom.
When I went earlier,
I brought back a heap of
≪Toadstool≫ and
≪Nitroshroom≫.
If you do get hit by the
flash of a ≪Gypceros≫, try
repeatedly pressing the
≪Arrow Keys≫, ≪Confirm≫,
and the ≪Number Keys≫.
You'll snap outta it
quicker!
I got some new stock, so
take a look when you've got
got enough ≪Huntercoin≫!
In the ≪Crags≫ I got a
whole load of a plant
called ≪Fire Herb≫.
They're 'specially useful
for use in combining items.
In the ≪Volcano≫ I was able
get something called an
≪Armor Seed≫.
Apparently they increase
defense... useful, huh?
You ever seen a
≪Hornet Bladefin≫?
Some ≪Hornetaur≫ have 'em,
seems they're a mutation.
Sometimes you can get one!
Hah, well, rarely.
The ≪Vespoid Abdomen≫ you
can get from ≪Vespoid≫...
It's a rare material that's
difficult to obtain.
Try checking where there's
an unusual amount of
≪Vespoid≫.
Hey you, know what a
≪Master's Skull≫ is?
I'm goin' absolutely nuts
trying to get one.
According to info I've
gathered, there should be
some in the
≪Forest & Hills Nests≫ and
the  ≪Dark Desert≫.
What kind of item is it?
What's it used for?
Looking forward to it, heh.
Found a ≪Barrel Lid≫ while
walkin' in the ≪Desert≫...
Isn't that just some trash?
Well, even items that look
useless at a first glance
can be helpful, so I took
it instead of tossing it.
The other day, while out
explorin' the ≪Swamp≫, I
found a ≪Lost Umbrella≫.
Looked like it just needed
some fixing up.
What's that?
You've been picking up a
bunch of junk recently?
Didn't I already say?
Even items that look
useless at a first glance
can be really helpful!
The heat laser attack of a
≪Gravios≫ can be guarded,
but it's better to evade.
Sure you can block it, but
you'll still take quite a
beating if you try.
I'm sure your journey up
to here was anything but
easy, but it's not over.
Day by day, we never stop.
That's the hunter's life!
Yo.
I see. So you're a hunter
too, huh?
I too travel the world
as a hunter.
Give me a holler sometime!
If you want my advice, I've
got you covered!
You can count on me.
Greatsword is a really
reliable weapon, I say.
It's got powerful attacks
that reach high & wide,
that's why!
You can take out hordes of
≪Velociprey≫ in one sweep!
It's a bit heavy and slow
to move with, though.
Just now, I was in hot
pursuit of a
≪Velocidrome≫, you see?
As soon as it sensed I was
a threat it ran away and
hid itself!
What a bother...
What'd you say!?
I should use a ≪Flashbomb≫
to stun it and keep it from
leaving?
I... that...
of course I knew that!
Ha, hahahahaha!!
When fighting a large
monster, firstly mark it on
the map with a ≪Paintball≫
or ≪Paint S≫.
When the thing runs away,
there'll be nowhere for it
to hide!
The small brown monsters in
the ≪Desert≫ are called
≪Genprey≫.
They've a nasty set of
paralyzing fangs & claws!
The Hammer is truly a
versatile weapon.
Charge attacks have 3
levels, depending on how
long you charge them for.
Let it fully charge, and
unleash a powerful attack!
The Bird Wyvern ≪Gypceros≫
has an unusually thick hide
compared to other monsters.
If you're gonna fight it,
bring a weapon with good
≪Sharpness≫!
The small red monsters
found around the ≪Crags≫
and ≪Volcano≫ are called 
≪Ioprey≫. Be careful, as
they have venomous spit!
The Sword & Shield has lots
of complexities to it.
Don't jump to conclusions
just 'cause it looks weak!
For example, when using a
weapon that applies
abnormal statuses, attack
speed is king!
That's where Sword & Shield
can truly shine!
Let me teach you something
today, from a pro to a
rookie.
≪Rathalos≫.
That thing's weak to dragon
element, and furthermore,
attacks to its head are
quite effective!
You've been having trouble
with egg delivery quests,
haven't you? Here's advice:
If you drink ≪Dash Juice≫
or ≪Mega Dash Juice≫ then
grab an egg, you can run to
base camp non-stop, without
even tiring!
That's my tactic.
Isn't it absolutely genius?
Eh!?
You already do that!??
You may find some monsters
that have unusual
coloration.
Apparently you can find
more of these strange
monsters by hunting other
monsters, or so it seems
at least.
Though, I have no clue
how many you have to hunt
for that to happen.
Well, for now I'll try
hunting 5 ≪Yian Kut-Ku≫
and see what happens.
Well, I did manage to find
a strangely-colored
≪Yian Kut-Ku≫, but I've yet
to find a ≪Rathalos≫ or a 
≪Rathian≫ with any
different coloring...
Have I not hunted enough？
Also, if you get a high 
rank quest by the same name
as in low rank, there'll be
a unique-colored monster.
Well, you CAN take on the
next rank of quests without
taking on those of the
unique-colored monsters...
I found something awesome
in the ≪Desert≫!
A wyvern with a giant horn,
≪Monoblos≫.
This thing's the big shot!!
Hehe, just you watch!
Now's the time to show off
my true hunting prowess!
Hahaha!
I'll never forget the look
of that terrifying horn...
What!?
The Monoblos you brought
down was sand-colored?
Hm... must just be a
different one that I took
down, yeah? Probably that.
The ≪Volcano≫'s resident
flying wyvern ≪Gravios≫.
It's got a rocky hide that
your run-of-the-mill weapon
just isn't gonna work on.
Well, I doubt that's of any
concern for you now.
What is it now?
And the ≪Black Gravios≫?!
As far as strength goes,
those're in another league!
Not by a ton, but... even I
don't feel I can top that.
Oh, I don't think I've seen
your face around here. 
So you're the new rookie?
I'm not trying to be mean,
but you should quit.
It's not worth it for such
a dangerous job.
Well, if you really want to
do it, it's not like I'm
gonna stop you, but...
Oh no, oh no, not good!
I... I-I saw ≪Velociprey≫
outside the village!
Blue scales, sharp claws!
If a whole pack arrives,
the village won't stand a
chance...
≪Velociprey≫ are brutal
pack-hunting carnivores.
They may seem weak as one,
but as soon as they gather
up in a pack...
L-listen!
A friend of mine saw a
≪Yian Kut-Ku≫ in the
≪Jungle≫!
A fire-spitting bird wyvern
is definitely dangerous!
Do you know?
The size and count of every
monster you've hunted can
be found in the Monster
Field Guide.
Well, I'm no hunter, but it
seems the ≪Measure≫ is what
hunters tend to call a
monster's size.
It's easy to ≪Measure≫
the length of a fish, but
a terrifying monster??
No WAY would you ever
see me trying that!
Do you know of the
≪Book of Combos≫?
You definitely ought to
have one when trying
difficult combinations.
There are volumes ①～⑤,
I hear carrying them in
order, starting with ①,
improves success rate.
Just make sure you put it
in your item pouch, or
it'll be of no use.
A ≪Gypceros≫ was spotted
in the ≪Crags≫!?
I heard the Chief talking
earlier, it's weak to fire!
Is this your first time in
the ≪Crags≫ & ≪Volcano≫?
If that's the case, you had
better bring many ≪Potion≫
and ≪Cool Drink≫.
Particularly the ≪Volcano≫
is known as a harsh locale.
There's a rocky flying
wyvern, ≪Basarios≫, that
inhabits the ≪Crags≫,
and according to the Chief,
it's got a poison gas
attack.
You should probably bring
≪Antidote≫.
獰猛で大型の飛竜、
≪リオレウス≫が≪火山≫で
目撃されたそうよ。
≪火山≫で
火竜との戦いだなんて
考えただけでもゾッとするわ。
とにかく、
無茶だけはしないことね。
あたし、この間、釣りしてたら
≪変な色≫の大怪鳥が
現れてもうビックリ！
ハンターさんにとっては
おなじみの鳥かしら？
でも、あんな色って…。
目の錯覚かしら？
It's known that 
≪Azure Rathalos≫ exist,
but I heard rumors that a
≪Pink Rathian≫ is a thing.
Could it be true!?
What do you think?
何か隣りの人、
すっかり、変な色した飛竜に
会うのに夢中みたいね。
そんなに会いたいものかしら？
ハンターの人って
よくわからないわ。
Hunter,
have you gotten any
≪Novacrystal≫ yet?
They're valuable stones and
come from ≪Quartz Ore≫.
If you have any of those,
you can make some strong
gear.
クリスタルハンティング、
なんて夢のあるひびき
なのかしら！ウットリ。
I heard the news!
You're really something,
taking down that Monoblos.
Though, actually...
Do Monoblos also have
different colors, I wonder?
村長の話だと、
≪火山≫に生息する
鎧竜は睡眠ガス攻撃を
仕掛けてくるそうよ。
厄介な攻撃だけど
≪ガード≫で防げるの
かしら！？
村長が言ってたわ。
あなたには
ハンターとしての資質が全て
備わっているって。
まあ、あたしの目に狂いは
なかったってことかしら！？
ニャ、ニャ、ニャ？
新米のハンターさんかニャ？
ハンターの仕事に油断は
禁物ニャ。
どんな活躍をしても、
ゲームデータを≪セーブ≫
しなかったら意味ないニャ。
≪セーブ≫はまめに行うニャ。
≪セーブ≫場所？
≪セーブ≫は左ソフトキーの
≪メニュー≫からできるニャ。
様々なアイテムには、
≪レア度≫というものが
ついているニャ。
よりレアな素材を使って
武具の強化・生産を行えば、
よりレアで強力な装備が
完成するニャ！
≪レア度≫の高いアイテムを
手に入れるためには、
すごく危険も伴うニャ。
気をつけるニャ。
生産リストにない武具でも
必要な素材を全てそろえると、
自然に生産リストに
足されるニャ。
中にはハンターランクを
上げると足される武具も
あるニャ。
新しい武具が足されたら
とにかく必要素材の確認ニャ。
アイテム屋に売っている
≪素材玉≫は調合にすごく
役立つニャ！
≪閃光玉≫やモンスターを
状態異常にする≪毒玉≫など
いろんなものが作れるニャ！
≪千里眼の薬≫を飲めば
少しの間だけ、
フィールドにいる
飛竜・ドス系モンスターの
位置を知ることができるニャ。
≪モドリ玉≫を使えば、
フィールドのどんな場所
からも一瞬で
ベースキャンプに戻る
ことができるニャ。
目的のアイテムをすぐに
納品したい時や支給品の
補充など、
その時の
状況に応じて使える、
便利アイテムニャ！
アイテム屋に置かれている
≪栄養剤≫は
≪アオキノコ≫と≪不死虫≫で
作れるニャ。
買わなくても手に入るニャ。
お金の節約ニャ！
≪火薬草≫と≪ニトロダケ≫を
調合すると≪爆薬≫が
作れるニャ。
≪爆薬≫は武器の素材に
利用されるニャ。
≪けむり玉≫は周囲の
モンスターに見つかりにくく
するアイテムニャ。
探索をしたい時に役立つニャ。
≪素材玉≫と≪ツタの葉≫を
調合すると作れるニャ。
≪にが虫≫と
≪ハチミツ≫の調合で、
≪増強剤≫ができるのは
知っているかニャ？
その≪増強剤≫に、
≪生焼け肉≫を調合すると、
なんと…
≪強走薬≫の完成ニャ。
すごいニャ！
この間、≪ジャングル≫で
≪マンドラゴラ≫って
呼ばれるキノコを発見
したニャ。
調合に使えそうな
気がするニャ。
すごい情報を
手に入れたニャ！
≪マンドラゴラ≫って
激レアなキノコと、
≪栄養剤グレート≫を
調合すると、なんと…
≪秘薬≫の完成ニャ！
すごすぎるニャ！
ニャ、ニャ、ニャー！
≪力の護符≫はもう手に
入れたかニャ？
持っているだけで、
攻撃力が上がる、
ありがたいお守りニャ。
ちょっと値段は高いけど
持っていても損はしない
はずニャ！
≪滅龍弾≫って
知っているかニャ？
龍属性が弱点のモンスターに
効く、特別な弾ニャ。
≪龍殺しの実≫と
≪カラ骨【大】≫を調合すると
完成ニャ！
またまた、すごい情報を
手に入れたニャ！
≪活力剤≫と、
≪ケルビの角≫を
調合すると、なんと…
≪いにしえの秘薬≫の
完成ニャ！
これを使えば
体力とスタミナが最大まで
上昇するニャ！
すごすぎるニャ！！
ニャ、ニャ、ニャ、
ニャ、ニャ、ニャー！！！
